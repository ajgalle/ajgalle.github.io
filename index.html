    <tr>
      <td>5/26/2017</td>
      <td>Finally uploaded some of my APIs utalizing projects from freeCodeCamp. JSON is still somewhat difficult for me, so the wikipedia viewer is still in the works.  In the meantime, please enjoy my RevaturePro project, Foodar.  It incorporates Javascript to check zipcodes, calculate totals, and more.  It also uses some new tricks they taught me with fetching form data and writing text over images. If you haven't heard of them, you should <a href='https://revature.com'>check them out. </a></td>
   </tr>
   
   <tr>
      <td>5/04/2017</td>
      <td>Finally I am ready to start making new projects with freeCodeCamp that use APIs, JavaScript, and more! They estimate it will take over 100 hours to complete these tasks. I redesigned the site today to prepare to showcase them.  Now the site uses Flexbox and some CSS3 animations. </td>
   </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5/02/2017</td>
      <td>Today I finally finished the last of the "think like a programmer" tasks on freeCodeCamp.  That's things like using for loops to iterate through arrays, reversing strings, getting my feet wet with regular expressions and other basic algorithim concepts.  I'm very  much looking forward to building something so I can apply all this.   </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>4/30/2017</td>
      <td>To get more experience with using Git and Gitcommits from the command line in linux, I've transitioned this page to githubpages. I will miss my cPanel capable site, but it should pay off in the long run.  </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>4/19/2017</td>
      <td>Today I started leaning into The Odin Project. I really liked FreeCodeCamp, and I think I'll keep at it, but I want to get out of the sandbox and start building tangible projects to stay motivated. So, today I created a Ubuntu dualboot environment and finished the install fest for Ruby, Rails, Sublime and what feels like a dozen more!  After optimizing all that, I'm finally ready to dive into the command line and hopefully that'll make Git a little more approachable when I circle back around for it. </td>
    </tr>
   
    <tr><td>4/18/2017</td>
    <td>Using some skills learned from FreeCodeCamp, I created this personal webpage which uses HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap.  I also added a small amount of flair using FontAwesome.</td></tr>
